## Overview
This project aims to predict the price of Uber and Lyft rides in Boston, MA, using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes ride-specific details such as distance, ride type, time, and weather conditions. By leveraging various machine learning models such as Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet, Random Forest, and XGBoost, the project identifies the most influential features affecting ride prices and provides robust predictions.

The work also includes cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and interpretability analysis using SHAP values to explain the predictions.
